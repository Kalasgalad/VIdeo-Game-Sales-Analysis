# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze video game sales from major and independent publishers over the course of a 40 year period. This analysis explores the connection between game popularity in terms of total sales; the relationship between which kind of games make it to be so popular, and which platforms performed the best over this period.

## Research Questions

1. Video game performance
   - Which video games were the top performers over this period?
  
2. Platform performance
   - Is there a relationship between consoles owned and top earning video games?
  
3. Genre popularity
   - Are the top earning games necessarily belonging to the most popular genres across each region?
  
4. Publisher popularity
   - Which publisher do consumers enjoy the most across each region?
  
## Summary of Research

Within the period of this dataset, analysis shows that the top earning game was Wii Sports, a game which does not particularly fit well within any gaming genre, nor a bestselling console. This remains a question throughout the analysis, since we do not have a strong correlation with other data to draw a solid conclusion.

Among top earning games, we have Grand Theft Auto V, Super Marios Bros., and Tetris.
The majority of these games belong to Nintendo. This makes sense because analysis shows that it is, in fact, the most popular publisher in the world according to this dataset.

When looking further at the success of Wii Sports, analysis determines that it is neither the most popular genre, nor the most popular console. We can assume that console popularity and game popularity go together, because PC games do not heavily feature here - which would allow console-less gameplay. 
Data suggests that the Wii console is definitely a major earner in its generation, but underperforms its competitors.

Finally, top genres include platformers, shooters, sports and racing games. This makes sense for most of the top earning games like Super Mario Bros. and Grand Theft Auto. Wii Sports belongs to the sports category; is among the best performing genres in the video game industry, yet statistically represents a lower sales figure than Platformers and Shooters.

The mystery of Wii Sports ensues...
